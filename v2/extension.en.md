## Extension Board

The extension board is designed for being plugged onto the base board.
It allows using a variety of sensors such as air pressure, humidity and temperature, as well as displays, gas meter, etc.
A buzzer my be connected as well for alarm output.

You can also experiment with the extension board when using it standalone, ie. without eBUS connection.
This makes it easy to connect sensors or displays to the Wemos.


### Construction
[<img src="img/exten-top.jpg" width="200" alt="extension" title="Extension board">](img/exten-top.jpg)

The number of components is a lot less compared to the base board and it consists mainly of female and male headers for connecting Wemos, displays, and sensors.

The power is supplied directly to the C-connector of the Wemos via a USB power supply.

### Part List

The necessary [parts are listed here](partlist.en).


### Assembly

The board is not lead free manufactured (HASL), so it can be soldered with normal leaded solder.
This is still legally allowed for private use as well as partly for commercial purposes.

The assembly of the extension board is carried out just as the base board according to usual rules, i.e. flat components first followed by the higher ones in layers as follows:

1. SMD switch (only for v2.0)
2. Resistors
3. Flat sockets
4. Capacitors
5. Switch
7. Socket headers
8. LEDs
9. Pin headers on the back for plugging onto base board
10. Plug in the Wemos D1 with its pin headers

Before soldering the resistors, be sure to check the resistance values with an ohm meter to avoid misplacing them.

**Important hints for version 2.0:**
- The two SMD buttons are a bit tricky and it is sufficient to use S3 only since the function of S2 is already provided by the S1 switch:
   - Place the SMD button with a finger and press it lightly (or press it with some light weight).
   - Then solder the already tinned soldering surface with the other hand.
   - Once the button is tidy, solder the second pin as usual and afterwards optionally solder the first pin again if needed.

**Important hints for all versions:**
- The LEDs sit on spacers, which are also a kink protection.  
  If you are using a clear case, the space should also match so that the LEDs are slightly higher than the top of the Wemos.
- You can exclude the UART sockets completely, since usually a Wemos is used.


#### Assembly variants

The possible [application variants are described here](index.en#usage).

Depending on the desired application many assembly variants are possible.
In particular, one should consider before soldering, whether and how for example BME280, OLED, Nextion, gas meters, NTC, Buzzer, etc. are to be connected.

If, for example, a BME280 is to be used outside the housing for measuring temperature etc., a 4-wire cable is required which is connected via a pin header, socket header, or directly to the extension board.
Depending on this, the corresponding socket and/or pin headers have to be selected and soldered.

The [jumper assignment depends on the variant used](#jumper-function-matrix) as well.

### Jumper Function Matrix

[<img src="img/exten-jumper-v22.png" width="200" alt="Jumper" title="Jumper v2.2">](img/exten-jumper-v22.png)  
Older versions are here: [v2.1](img/exten-jumper-v21.png) [v2.0](img/exten-jumper-v20.jpg)

On the back of the extension board there are some jumpers (solder bridges) that allow different assignments depending on the desired sensors or used Wemos firmware.

Depending on the desired application variant for the extension board, the jumpers have to be taken care of as otherwise the sensors won't work.

**Important:** The Wemos with ESPEasy may not be jumpered to RX and TX, as otherwise the signals from the simultaneously connected Wemos would be grounded with ebusd-esp!  
Such errors may not seem to make any difference at first, but certainly show up once several devices are connected to the eBUS.

* `2-1` means: connect the middle soldering point to the right one.

**Example 1:** in case a Wemos with with ESPEasy and a BME280 shall be connected, no jumpers have to be set.

**Example 2:** in case a Wemos with ebusd-esp shall be used directly on the extension board, the jumpers SJ4/SJ3 have to be connected as stated in the table.

**Attention:** the layout of SJ8+SJ4 is wrong, as the originally middle pin is placed on the right!

### Jumpers when fully equipped

[<img src="img/exten-full.jpg" width="200" alt="Assembly" title="Assembly">](img/exten-full.jpg)

This image shows a variant with full configuration: the base board with Wemos ebusd-esp, the extension board with ESPEasy and a BME280 sensor for temperature, humidity, and pressure.

In this variant no jumpers have to be set for the Wemos with ebusd-esp, since it is attached to connector JP8 and this directly has both, the RX and TX signal.

The Wemos with ESPEasy is plugged onto the expansion board and thus uses all the pin headers provided.
If ESPEasy is located on the extension board and is connected to the BME280 sensor, no jumpers (v2.2) or jumpers SJ8/SJ4 (v2.1) or SJ2/SJ1 (v2.0) have to be set.

#### Jumpers fully equipped for version 2.2

For version 2.2, no jumper has to be set for the fully equipped variant described above and the I2C settings on ESPEasy can remain on default (D1/D2).

#### Jumpers fully equipped for version 2.1

| Sensor  | Wemos PINs |  SJ8  |  SJ4  | SJ7 | SJ3 | SJ6 | SJ2 | SJ5 | SJ1 |
|---------|------------|-------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| BME280  | **D3/D4**  |**2-1**|**2-1**|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| OLED    | **D3/D4**  |**2-1**|**2-1**|     |     |     |     |     |     |

**Attention:** With these jumper settings for v2.1, the I2C settings on ESPEasy have to be changed to D3/D4.

#### Jumpers fully equipped for version 2.0

| Sensor  | Wemos PINs |  SJ2  |  SJ1  | SJ3 | SJ4 | SJ5 | SJ6 | SJ8 | SJ7 |
|---------|------------|-------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| BME280  | **D1/D2**  |**1-2**|**1-2**|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| OLED    | **D1/D2**  |**1-2**|**1-2**|     |     |     |     |     |     |

With these jumper settings for v2.0, the I2C settings on ESPEasy can remain on default (D1/D2).

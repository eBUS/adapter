eBUS adapter
============

This repository is for creating online documentation of an eBUS adapter for communicating with eBUS devices connected to
a 2-wire bus system ("energy bus" used by numerous heating systems).

The old v2 documentation is still kept here [Version 2](https://adapter.ebusd.eu/v2/), where the latest version is
available here: [https://adapter.ebusd.eu/](https://adapter.ebusd.eu/)

eBUS adapter
============

This is the archived documentation repository for an eBUS adapter for communicating with eBUS devices connected to
a 2-wire bus system ("energy bus" used by numerous heating systems).

[The current documentation is published directly to the website: https://adapter.ebusd.eu/](https://adapter.ebusd.eu/).

The former version 3.0 documentation is also still kept available there: [https://adapter.ebusd.eu/v30/](https://adapter.ebusd.eu/v30/).

The same applies to the old v2 documentation: [https://adapter.ebusd.eu/v2/](https://adapter.ebusd.eu/v2/).
